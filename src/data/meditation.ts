It's not about stopping thoughts, but about observing them without judgment, cultivating a state of detached witnessing. In the yogic tradition, Mahadeva (Shiva) is revered as the Adiyogi, the first yogi and the ultimate master of meditation, eternally absorbed in the stillness of pure consciousness.",

His stillness represents the unchanging, eternal consciousness (Purusha) underlying all of existence. His third eye signifies the eye of wisdom (Jnana Chakshu) opened through deep introspection. Dakshinamurthy, his form as the silent teacher, imparts profound wisdom through meditative stillness. Practicing meditation is a way to connect with this inner Shiva-nature â€“ the silent, aware, blissful Self.",
